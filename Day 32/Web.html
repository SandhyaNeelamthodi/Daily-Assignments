        <p>A book is a medium for recording <u>information in the form of writing or images</u>, 
            typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) 
            bound together and protected by a cover.[1] The technical term for this physical 
            arrangement is <i>codex (plural, codices)</i>. In the history of hand-held physical supports 
            for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor,
             the scroll. <b>A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page</b>.
