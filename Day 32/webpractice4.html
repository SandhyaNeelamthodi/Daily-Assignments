        <h2>What is AI</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines,
        as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or by other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition,
        computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.AI applications include advanced web 
        search engines (e.g., Google Search),recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
         self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo),generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in
          strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).</p>

          <h2>History of AI</h2>
          <p>By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, 
            was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that 
            could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. 
            Closely associated with this approach was the "heuristic search" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of 
            exploring a space of possibilities for answers.</p>
            <h2>Goals of AI</h2>
            <p>Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions 
                intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.A representation of "what exists" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, 
                concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.[53] The most general ontologies are 
                called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about
                a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). 
                A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows. 
                The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.</p>

                <h2>Tools of AI</h2>
                <p>AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[87] Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. 
                    For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application 
                    of an inference rule.[88] Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal,
                    a process called means-ends analysis.[89] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space</p>

                <h2>Applications of AI</h2>
                <p>AI is relevant to any intellectual task.[138] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.
                    Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect</p>
